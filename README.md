### Token Mechanics

Maker [Dai](https://makerdao.com/en/dai) is a USD-pegged stablecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain, and has no centralized authority. Its $1 USD equivalent is maintained through automatic pricing mechanisms built into smart contracts. Dai can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token, and anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it without a middleman.

GDAI is an ERC-20 token that is minted when DAI is sent to the GDAI contract. The minting process take a portion of the DAI sent to the contract and converts it into a carbon offset. This is done by sending the carbon offset percentage of DAI to a carbon offset purchase pool. Once minted the new GDAI can be used for payments. Anyone that holds the GDAI can unwrap the DAI, essentially freeing the DAI and un-minting (burning) the GDAI token. During the unwrapping another percentage of DAI is moved to the carbon offset purchasing pool, leaving the recipient with the final DAI amount (Dwrapped - Coffset).
